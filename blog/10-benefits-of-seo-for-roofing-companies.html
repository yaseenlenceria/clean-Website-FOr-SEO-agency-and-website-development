                            <h2>Introduction: Why SEO Matters for Roofers</h2>
                            <p>In the roofing industry, 90% of homeowners search online before hiring a roofer. If your roofing company isn’t showing up in Google search results, you’re missing out on dozens of potential clients every month.</p>
                            <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of optimizing your website and online content to rank higher on Google and other search engines, making it easier for customers to find you when they need roofing services.</p>
                            <div class="highlight-box">
                                <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Key Takeaway</h3>
                                <p>Roofing companies that invest in SEO can see a <strong>3X–10X return on investment</strong> compared to traditional advertising methods.</p>

                            <p>SEO brings in people actively searching for your services. When someone types “emergency roof repair in [city],” you want to be the company they see first — and call.</p>
                            <p>By targeting high-intent keywords, SEO ensures your website attracts homeowners ready to hire, not just browsers.</p>

                            <p>Roofing is a local business, and local SEO ensures you appear in Google Maps, local packs, and “near me” searches. Optimizing your Google Business Profile and using location-based keywords like “roof replacement in [city]” makes it easy for local clients to find you.</p>

                            <p>Unlike paid ads that stop when you stop paying, SEO offers lasting visibility. Once your site ranks well, it can generate leads 24/7 without ongoing ad costs.</p>
